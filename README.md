# MyReads Project

In this App, you can create your custom bookshelf that will allow you to select and categorize books in 3 categories:

* Currently reading
* Want to read
* Read

You can also search for some books with selected queries and add them in the bookshelf where you want to assign them.

The application is developed using ReactJS framework.

## Installation

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`



## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Important 
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
